This is a very simple command list maker. 
It will either print all your server commands to the server console or save them as JSON. 
The only reason I made this is that I was getting fed up with keeping track of my commands and just wanted to build my server, then get all the commands later on, and change them if needed.
It has helped me, so hopefully, it will help you too.

Correct way to use this resource:

Add it to your [resource] folder.

Do not add it to server.cfg.

Let your server start up, 
then in the server console, type:start command-list-maker
This will start my resource and generate the command list, taking all commands from all your resources.

Remember to check the config and change it to your preference (print or JSON).
